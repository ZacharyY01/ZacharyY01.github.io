# This account has been recently made to host future project as I progress through my online course
# the readme repository I have created is a basic coding file for web deleopment 
# I created the repository file on the github website then downloaded the desktop appliction and then cloned the readme file I created and downloaded it to my pc
#About Me
## Two of my main hobbies are vfx and gaming  my goal is to find a way to bridge the two intrests and make a career out of it. with this goal in mind I decided to persue a degree in computer programming.
## Two websites recommend for getting started in the software I use are 
      - [Sidefx] (https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/) - I use this website to gain a better understanding of its native coding language and simulations
      - [Cgwiki]    (https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/HoudiniVex1.html) - I use this website as a cookbook for simulations and advance coding techniques that
      makes my simulations look more advanced
